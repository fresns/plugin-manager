Enhance Laravel Apps: Organized & Scalable

Plugin Manager is a convenient Laravel extension package designed for modular management of your large-scale Laravel applications. Each plugin acts as an independent Laravel application or microservice, allowing you to define your own views, controllers and models.

## Features

### Plug and Play

Register and mount plug-ins as service providers for easy decoupling and plug-and-play functionality.

### Rapid Development

Provides development, control and management commands for convenient and fast plug-in construction via the terminal.

### Effortless Management

Manage the installation, uninstallation, activation and deactivation of plug-ins using event listeners.

### Independent Dependencies

Each plugin has its own Composer configuration, avoiding coupling with the main program for easier management and flexible development.

### Interoperability

Plug-ins and the main program, as well as different plug-ins, can call each other's functionality using the Command Word Manager.

### Ecosystem Support

Use plug-ins from Fresns application ecosystem or create your own to unleash your creativity with flexibility and freedom.

## Use Cases

Plugin Manager has been used in the Fresns community app and has built an ecosystem of Fresns apps.

Fresns is a free and open source social network service software, a general-purpose community product designed for cross-platform, and supports flexible and diverse content forms. It conforms to the trend of the times, satisfies a variety of operating scenarios, is more open and easier to re-development.
